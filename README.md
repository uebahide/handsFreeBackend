 **Backend**
 - Navigate to the backend directory
 - Create a Conda environment (Make sure Anaconda/Miniconda is installed)
 - Check if your Python version is 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9. Otherwise, it doesn't work well.
 - Install dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt
`
 - Run the backend with `python main.py`
 - You see a line in the terminal with Running on http://x.x.x.x:yyyy.
 - x.x.x.x is the server IP address. It should be input into profile of the frontend application
 - yyyy is the server port number. It should be input into profile of the frontend application
